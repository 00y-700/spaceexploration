## Challenges Faced

* For making video more responsive and appealing for the eyes.
* While implementing Search engine for homepage.
* Extracting required contents from the response especially while making two api calls for the same.
* Successes: Overcome all the challenges faced by knowledge sharing and also by researching online with some serious Google Fu.
